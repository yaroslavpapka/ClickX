Clickhouse Metrics Tracker
Overview

The Clickhouse Metrics Tracker is a web application that tracks button clicks and stores metrics (IP, browser, device) in Clickhouse. All clicks are processed in the background using Oban, and data is visualized in real-time on a graph.

    Clickhouse for Analytics: Stores and analyzes click data.

    PostgreSQL: Stores metadata and application settings.

    Oban: Processes clicks in the background.

    Real-Time Graph: Displays click data over time, by IP, or by browser.

Modules & Features
üìä Click Metrics Tracking

    Every button click is tracked with IP, browser, and device information.

    Data is stored in both PostgreSQL and Clickhouse for later analysis.

Clickhouse Table for Metrics:

CREATE TABLE metrics
(
    event_time DateTime,
    ip String,
    browser String,
    device String
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY event_time;

üõ†Ô∏è Oban Background Processing

Each click is processed in the background using Oban to insert it into Clickhouse.
Oban Worker for Click Processing:

defmodule ClickhouseMetricsTracker.Workers.BatchInsert do
  use Oban.Worker, queue: :clickhouse

  @impl Oban.Worker
  def perform(_job) do
    # Logic for batch inserting clicks into Clickhouse
  end
end

üìà Click Graph

A graph is displayed on the webpage showing the number of clicks over time. You can filter the graph by:

    Date range

    Browser

    IP

üì§ Batch Insert to Clickhouse

Every 60 seconds, we batch insert all the clicks processed by Oban into Clickhouse for efficient querying.
