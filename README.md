## Overview

The **Clickhouse Metrics Tracker** is a web application built with **Elixir Phoenix LiveView** that records and visualizes user interactions. The system logs button clicks, capturing details such as the device, IP address, and browser information. Data is stored in **PostgreSQL** and periodically inserted into **ClickHouse** for efficient analytics.

## Features

- **Real-time Click Tracking**: Every button click is recorded instantly.
- **Batch Processing**: Clicks are stored in an in-memory queue and inserted into ClickHouse every 60 seconds.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: A page displaying a graph of clicks over time.
- **Filterable Metrics**: Users can filter clicks by time range, browser, and IP address.
- **Dockerized Setup**: PostgreSQL and ClickHouse run in Docker for easy deployment.
